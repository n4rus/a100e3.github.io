f'(x)= (f'*g)*g = (f*g)'                                             ###{c program }
df/dx = dg/dg * dg/dx                                                ###{gnu-plot graphics}

Ex1.: f(x) = (x²+1)³.Tenis qye F(x) = h(g(x))) onde g(x)=x²+1
      e h((g)) = (g(x))³. Então,
        
        h(g(x)) = (g(x))³           Ex.: 4(4(4)) = (4(4))³           ###{ 4*4*4(4(4))³=4096 not equal to 64 }
        Então 
        f'(x)=3(x²+1²)(2x)
            
            =6x(x²+1)²
 In analogous mode in trygonometric functions
  f(x)=sin(x)² = f(x) = h(g(x)) com h(x)=sin(x) e g(x)=x²
  f'(x)=2xcos(x²)

 Since h'(g(x)) = cos(x²) e g'(x) = 2x

The Impure world,
H(x) = 8infinitum-simbol(void);
each function is,
if not,
fluctuation, 
of the all.

The artist eExternalizes the tought, participates in the art wich makes him;
The scientist takes an step back, observes and computes the variables;

The mad scientist don't get preoccupied with such definitions always;
Observes and computes while extenuates, live the experiments wich makes him.
