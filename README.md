The main product at the start where the LED panels and cryptocurrency management, while other scaling properties such as energy, information,
and cryptocurrency management for investments and exchange. Because of the health crisis and lack of investments the focus was changed to software,
and now in the end of 2021, it changed again to marketing and content production on social media, primordially at youtube and twich. 

As stated on other texts that are kept at PI repository, linking the content through social media is pretty much essential, so besides choosing those 
two as start point, others may be added with time. 

Other files and archives related to white-void comic are also being used and linked as the brand artwork, besides being main part of the business marketing.
The goals for the following year are most related to the ongoing tasks aiming to be fully operational again between the end of 2022 and mid 2023, following 
the average time it took to develop the task since the start untill now.

This README file is intended to state some goals of the company and the ongoing tasks and operations they are coveting in the year average, starting with the 
end of first year(07/2020-01/2021), and start of the second(07/2021-01/2022).
